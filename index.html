      <p>  This is my portfolio, this include everything a person wants to hire me want to see, I basically concentrate on developing the graphic factor of the website. Personally, I think the first thing that touch an user's mind is the look and feel, it's the same as an impression on a person you meet for the first time, how they look will be the first and the biggest factor to contribute to how you interact and feel about them. I think website is the same, you can take it as a tool, a commercial object or an interactive system that serve a particular purpose but to me, website also needs to be more than that. For example, an eye catching website is much more interesting and will be clicked on much more than a website with just words, essay and links. Scientist also showed that, the human brain memorize pictures with relevant meaning much better than words, so an eye catching website with pictures, with interaction, with widget, with a "pretty face" will be remembered much better by the user than a wordy website, and that factor right there, being remembered by users and client is the one priority that every e-commerce website want.</p>
